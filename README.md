**LangGraph Customer Support Agent**
A sophisticated AI agent built with LangGraph that models customer support workflows as graph-based stages with intelligent decision making and MCP server integration.

**🤖 Meet Clara**
Clara is a structured and logical LangGraph Agent that:
- 🧩 Thinks in stages: each node represents a clear phase of the workflow
- 🔄 Carries forward state variables from one stage to the next
- 🎯 Knows whether to execute sequentially (deterministic) or choose dynamically (non-deterministic)
- 🌐 Orchestrates MCP clients to call either Atlas or Common servers as needed
- 📝 Logs every decision clearly and outputs a final structured payload

**🏗️ Architecture Overview**

*11-Stage Workflow Pipeline*
INTAKE → UNDERSTAND → PREPARE → ASK → WAIT → RETRIEVE → DECIDE → UPDATE → CREATE → DO → COMPLETE
  📥        🧠         🛠️      ❓     ⏳       📚       ⚖️       🔄       ✍️      🏃      ✅

*Stage Types*
- 🔒 Deterministic: Execute abilities in fixed sequence
- 🎲 Non-deterministic: Dynamic ability orchestration at runtime
- 👤 Human Interaction: Pause for human input
- 📦 Payload Only: Process state without external calls

*MCP Server Integration*
- 🌐 ATLAS Server: External system interactions (databases, APIs, notifications)
- ⚙️ COMMON Server: Internal processing (text parsing, calculations, scoring)

**🚨 Key Feature: Intelligent Decision Making**
*The DECIDE stage (Stage 7) is the heart of the system:*

- 📊 Evaluates solutions and scores them 1-100
- 🎯 Escalation Logic: If score < 90 → escalate to human agent
- 🤖 Auto-resolution: If score ≥ 90 → continue with automated resolution
- 📝 Decision Audit: Records reasoning for compliance and debugging

**🛠️ Installation & Setup**
*Prerequisites*
- Python 3.9+
- pip install -r requirements.txt

**🚀 Usage**
*Quick Start Demo*
- python main.py
- Choose option 1 for the demo with sample data.

**📊 Monitoring & Logging**
*The agent provides comprehensive logging:*
- Execution Logs: Every stage execution with timing
- State Persistence: Complete state history for debugging
- Decision Audit: Reasoning for all escalation decisions
- Error Tracking: Detailed error messages and stack traces
